  I left the lawn care industry in 2019 to pursue a career in IT. It has been a wild ride so far and I am excited to keep learning. 
  Graduating from St. Lawrence College in 2022 with an advanced diploma in computer programming and analysis gave me a strong foundation in the fundamentals of development.
  I started work as a Junior Software Engineer at Elentra in 2021. After almost 2 years, I have worked across the stack and settled as a back end engineer.
  I am also a Certified Scrum Master and have been acting in that role for several month. I love the challenge of group/process optimization and agile implementation and refinement.
