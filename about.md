Hello, my name is Philip Lalonde.

I am a software engineer and IT analyst. I founded Jade Pug in 2022 to capture the release of apps and projects. After deploying a few apps and taking on one freelance project, I wanted to start this blog to share some of what I've learned through the process. Also selfishly, I hope this will be a good place to record some of my learning.
